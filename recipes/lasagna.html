    <h2>What is it?</h2>

    <p>A savory meal for lunch or dinner. Made with a meaty, tomato sauce layered with pasta and cheese in between.</p>
  
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ground beef</strong> - We used 80/20 beef (20% fat content) for a juicier lasagna.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion</strong> - We use yellow onion, or sweet onion works well</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic cloves</strong> - You can add more if you love garlic.</li>
        <li><strong>Red wine (or beef broth)</strong> - This amps up the flavor of your sauce (avoid using cooking wine).</li>
        <li><strong>Marinara sauce</strong> - Use <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/marinara-sauce/">homemade marina</a> or store-bought.</li>
        <li><strong>Dried thyme</strong> - Italian seasoning, basil, or oregano can be substituted.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong> - Balances the acidity of the tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Parsley</strong> - Flat-leaf or curly parsley works well.</li>
        <li><strong>Lasagna noodles</strong> - Cook these al dente; they'll continue to soften as the lasagna bakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Cottage cheese</strong> - Adds great texture and moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Ricotta cheese</strong> - We use low-fat or part-skim ricotta.</li>
        <li><strong>Mozzarella cheese</strong> - An Italian cheese blend works, but mozzarella is definitely the classic choice.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg</strong> - Helps hold the chees layer together.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to make it</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Brown the beef</strong> - Add oil to a deep pan and sautee onion and beef until browned. 5 minutes then add garlic and stir another minute.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish the sauce</strong> - Pour in 1/4 cup of wine and stire until almost evaporated. Add marinara, salt, pepper, thyme, sugar, and parsley; bring to a  simmer, then cover and cook 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the cheese filling</strong> - Combine all of the cheese sauce ingredients and 1 cup of mozzarella in a mixing bowl (reserve the rest for later)</li>
        <li><strong>Prep</strong> - Preheat your oven to 375F and cook the lasagna noodles in a pot of well-salted water until al dente.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble</strong> - Spred 1/2 cup of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Add 3 noolds, followed by 1/3 of the meat sauce, 1 cup of mozzarella, and half of the ricotta mixture. Repeat, then for the top layer, add 3 noodles, 1/3 of the meat sauce, and the remaining mozzarella.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake</strong> - Cover with foil and bake at 375F for 45 minutes, then remove the foil and broil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cheese is lightly browned.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest</strong> - Let the lasagna rest for about 30 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
    </ol>
